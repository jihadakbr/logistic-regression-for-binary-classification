# Logistic Regression for Binary Classification

This project was completed as a part of the Honors portion of the [Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) Course on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/).

Credit to IBM and the Coursera platform for providing the course materials and guidance.

## Objective

My objective is to serve as the administrator of a university department and assess the likelihood of admission for each applicant by using logistic regression for binary classification. I will analyze their performance on two exams and determine their chance of admission. To achieve this, I will utilize historical data of previous applicants as a training set for logistic regression. Each training example includes the applicant's scores on the two exams along with their admissions decision. The primary goal is to construct a classification model that can predict an applicant's probability of admission based on the exam scores provided.
